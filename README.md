## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with creating a progressive budget tracker that allows users to track income and expenses both on and offline.

Starting out I was provided with some starter code for the front end which was very helpful.  After re-listening to the previous weeks lessons and going through some of the exercies I was able to add all the successful files.  My struggle though came from one small error in not requiring the db file in the html.  Fortunately after talking with classmates they were able to help me which I was very thankful for.
